    "## Overview \n",
    "Welcome to EngageMetrics' GitHub Integration Lab! In this hands-on session, you'll learn to manage version control for data science projects using GitHub. You'll work with the Employee Insights dataset, creating and maintaining a repository for your analysis notebook while learning best practices for version control in data science workflows.\n",
    "If you get stuck or need a refresher, refer back to the screencast where we demonstrated these concepts step-by-step. The video shows similar examples that can help guide you through this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes \n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Initialize and structure a Git repository for a data science project\n",
    "- Write clear, descriptive commit messages following data science best practices\n",
    "- Push changes to GitHub while managing notebook metadata\n",
    "- Implement version control best practices for Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Information \n",
    "You'll be working with the <b>employee_insights_cleaned.csv</b> dataset from EngageMetrics, containing employee satisfaction scores, work modes, and performance metrics."
